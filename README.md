## **Employee-Details**
_In this project I created A Web form having Employee Detail Fields with Employee Id,Employee Name and Email Address and I provide data to the Webform and it is stored at the Json Database._

**Introduction to JSON DB :**
_JSON is fastest growing trend,It has explosive growth in recent years,JSON becomes de-facto standard for data and communication,If a query runs 10 times faster on a new technology
database, because of its reduces cost of 10(theoretically)7-9(practically)systems.JSON Technology system handles workload of 7-9 systems,High performance, Low cost, efficient._

**Features:**
 - actions are performed quickly, simple to use, having more memory, real time
- schema free: easy to maintain
- By using this built world's fastest index" power Index"
- Serverlesssupport: easy to develop and market
- Uses web service APIs : low cost
- Multimode database: one solution to variety of data
- Single instance for million indexes 
- Inbuilt support for querying multiple databases
- multiple security layers
- servside native No SQL: best performance

**JSON Data base supports:**
*	Document database
* key value data base
*	RDBMS
* Geo special
* Wide column stores
* Time series data base

**Benefits of using JsonPowerDB**
- Minimize development  cost
- minimize time to market 
- Maximize data processing and performance
- minimize complexity of interoperability of different applications
- minimize total cost of ownership
